# lurk

An interpreter for the Krul language.

## About

This interpreter parses Krul code files _(\*.txt)_ and executes the matched expressions. When a file ends, the last value is used as the file name of the file that is yet to be parsed. Execution of the Krul program will stop when an **end** expression is interpreted. For more information about all the possible expressions, have a look at the following chapter.
